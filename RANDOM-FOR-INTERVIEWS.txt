what is the role for this position
ask about onboarding process

conditionally create a key in object

delete a key from object=>delete,reduce,spread,by making a function,pass a object to function,dynamic key

seal and freeze

reduce
  // sum
  // average
  // double the array values
  // filter numbers that dont need to be double
  // flatten an array
  // filter duplicates
  // count identities
  //with reduce /foreach
  //https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/reduce-f47a7da511a9/

does reduce,map,slice and filter mutates the original aaray 

useReducer is useful for handling more complex state easily as compared to useState
useRef
useMemo
useCallback

array method which mutates it (splice,push,pop)

spread operator

myarray.push(2) it will return the length of that array

tokenization techniques for frontend

difference between FOR and FOREACH loop? (for can be used for different things but forEach can only be used for Arrays)

guard clasues instead of nested if else

difference between import and require (answer can me dynamic importing possible with imports)

difference between useEffect & useLayoutEffect (useLayoutEffect is beneficial when encountering flickering effect)

difference between useState & useReducer (useReducer is basically used for more complex state management)

difference between useMemo & useCallback

defer vs async

delete a key from object without mutating it (spread,reduce)

delete a an object from array without mutating array (filter)

can we use useContext as a alternative to Redux? (yes we can combine useContext with useReducer to make it work like Redux for small applications,but useContext alone cannt be an alternative), Redux is for large projects & Context API for small ones.

what are controlled and uncontrolled compoenents in reacts

what is event bubbling and how to prevent it?

what is event delegation?

what is debouncing?

what is throttling?

difference between forEach and Map? for of and Map? (map will create a new execution context for every callback function so basically it is a bit slow as compared to for of loop)

difference between null and undefined?

difference between promise.all vs promise.allsettled

object.seal() vs object.freeze()
