dynamic import
does using react component composition give perfomance benefit??
create element AND children OR RE RENDER
(!  !!)

this
closures
lexical scope


debouncing

react 18
database
node js

custom hook
stale closures
react query
react perfomance
setState is sync or async
setTimeout precedence for multiple settimeout

promises
reverse string using for loop
palindrome
===
cont arr=[1,2,3]
arr=[2,3,4]       //will it work
======

setState
if(state){  //will i get state here
will do something here
}

generators works under async await

for loops dont support async events except for of

set Timeout with 0 value


react composition pattern (adrian)
difference between imperative hook and declarative hook
 is setTimeout sync or async

New
With the keyword new you can create instances of an object. For instance, if we create a Plane object, we can invoke a new instance of Plane called “redPlane” of type Plane.

function Dog(breed) {
  this.breed = breed;
}
const shibaInu = new Dog('Shiba inu')
But arrow functions can’t be used as constructors, so you can’t invoke them with new. If you try, you will receive the following error : TypeError: Car is not a constructor

function Dog(color) {
  this.breed = breed;
}
const shibaInu = new Dog('Shiba inu'); // TypeError: Dog is not a constructor




This
Arrow functions do not have their own this. If you don’t know what the keyword this is, let me explain.

Inside a function, this is an object, referring to the execution context. The value of this object is dynamic, depending on how you invoke the function expression.

Inside an arrow function this always equals the value of the outer environment, it doesn’t define its own execution context.

how react work under the hood

prototype


setTimeout(() => {
      setFormFields(refactoedFields)

      setTimeout(() => {
        handlePdfDownload(document.getElementById('content'), setpdfLoadingDescription, fileName, fileHeading, itemsInfoHeadings, itemsInfo, heightForCanvas, isNegativeList)
        setPdfGeneration(false)
        setFormFields(originalFields)
      }, 2000)
    }, 0);
  }

can i push value to array assigned with const

dynamic object with nested data structire (daru explanation)


what is meant by one way data binding in react

new Promise((resolve,reject)=>{
setTimeout(()=>{
resolve('hello')
},0)
})

immutability and pure functions.



REACT PERFOMANCE
-----------------------
API optimisations
Code Bundling
Dependency optimisation
Throttling or Debouncing
React Fragments and styling conventions




callback and promise
aysnc await and promise


how to compare two arrays are same or not

how redux works with pure function



let arr=['1'.'2','3']
let str='1,2,3'

consloge.log(arr==str)

how type coercion is working here


CUSTOM Formik hook
-------------------------

import { wizardFormSubmit, stepIncrement } from "store/actioncreators/wizard";
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from "react-redux";

const useWizardFormSubmit = () => {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  const currentStep = useSelector((state) => state.wizard.step);

  const onSubmit = (data) => {
    dispatch(wizardFormSubmit(data));
    dispatch(stepIncrement(currentStep + 1));
  };

  return { onSubmit, currentStep };
};

export default useWizardFormSubmit;



closure and set timeout by akshay saini




console.log('7*6')



does map create new array
post request

console.log([1,2]==[1,2])
console.log([1,2]===[1,2])
//false false because of reference equality


+= (it adds right value to left)  & =+ (it converts to number)

console.log([1,2]+[3,4])

return inside then not working but working inside await

hook can only work inside a Component and other Hooks not in a callback as well

coercion or ||


for (let i=0,i<=5,i++)  vs for (let i=0,i<=5,++i)

nested data in obj 
obj.key1.key2 or obj[key1.key2.key3]


object and array (order is not important in objects we can destructure any element from any where in the object)


can not return from then (should use await)

let mystring='hello world'
mystring.toUpperCase()
console.log(mystring.split(' '))     //['hello','world']  not ['HELLO','WORLD']


bubbling and stopPropagation


microtask macro task

akshay saini videos

cont values=['web','undefined','js',null,false]
values.filter((values)=>Boolean(value))   X
values.filter(Boolean) //shorthand

var x=10
var display=function(){
console.log(x)

is setState async???
does react set all states again one one is setState

ref and forward ref  (parent pass its ref to child)

make an object of country list from excel file

substr and slice

documnet issue [] initail value for loading but data also come empty

custom hook for post and get call

multiple if conditions then else =>will else run or not

[] result???

console.log(10<20<30) true
console.log(30>20>10) false

multiple setTimeouts at one time how they will work

var a = 2

  function krishan() {
    console.log('sjhsjd', a)
    var a = 3
  }
  krishan()

time complexity and space complexity
